## Description

ENT510 Ox Elevator is a module designed to manage elevators within the game. Defines the various elevator zones, each with related settings, such as entry and exit locations, available floors, and access options. Each zone can contain multiple floors, each with a name, description, and other options such as using a password to access. Furthermore, it is possible to associate a specific signaling icon with each zone for better identification on the game map. This module simplifies elevator management, giving developers an efficient way to integrate this functionality into their game projects.
